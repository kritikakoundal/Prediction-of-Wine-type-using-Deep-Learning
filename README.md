## Features
- **Deep Learning-Based Classification**: Predicts wine type (red or white) using neural networks.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps for data cleaning, normalization, and feature selection.
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate performance.

## Dataset
- **Source**:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Description**: This dataset contains chemical properties of wines, such as acidity, alcohol content, and pH, which serve as features to classify wines into red or white categories.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps taken include handling missing values, normalization, and encoding.

## Model Architecture
- **Architecture**: Describe the type of neural network used (e.g., DNN, CNN).
- **Layers**: Include a brief description of the layers and their parameters, such as the activation functions, dropout, and optimizer.
- **Loss Function**: State the loss function (e.g., binary cross-entropy) and optimizer (e.g., Adam) used.
